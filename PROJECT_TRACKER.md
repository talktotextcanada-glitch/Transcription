## Key Decisions
- (2026-03-28) Subtitle export (SRT/VTT) includes speaker name prefixes and respects edited segment text; generated client-side via Blob download
- (2026-03-28) Sticky toolbar has two rows: action buttons (Edit/Share/Export/Search) + speaker controls (timestamp freq, speaker pills, highlight, edit speakers)
- (2026-03-23) Account deletion removes Firebase Auth + Firestore user doc + subcollections + transcriptions + transactions + storage files; admins cannot delete other admin accounts without removing role first
- (2026-03-23) Transcription deletion cleans up both Firestore document and all associated storage files (audio, transcript, template)
- (2026-03-23) Re-registration allowed after account deletion (email becomes available again); no blocklist mechanism added
- (2026-03-19) Disavowed 20 spam backlink domains; monitor Search Console over next few weeks for recovery
- (2026-03-19) Both talktotext.ca (domain) and www.talktotext.ca (URL prefix) properties set up in Search Console; www is the canonical version
- (2026-03-18) GA4 Data API used server-side with 5-min cache; analytics section hidden gracefully when credentials not configured
- (2026-03-18) Speaker highlighting is purely client-side with Set-based toggle; works across all three transcript view modes
- (2026-03-18) Admin-uploaded transcript files stored as-is in Firebase Storage and served directly to users, no parsing/formatting applied
- (2026-03-18) "Your Work" section placed below business metrics on admin dashboard (metrics at top preferred)
- (2026-03-18) Removed Recent Jobs and Recent Users sections from admin dashboard as redundant with Your Work queue
- (2026-03-18) Removed fake System Health section (Math.random data) rather than replacing with real monitoring
- (2026-03-18) Renamed "Human Transcription" to "Dictation & Human Transcription" across the app

## Notes
- Speechmatics API used for AI transcription processing
- Template upload supports .docx, .doc, .txt, .pdf, .rtf
- Admin transcript upload supports same formats, stored without parsing
- Landing page mascot at /public/mascot.png, shown on desktop only (lg: breakpoint)
- GA4 requires env vars: GA4_PROPERTY_ID, GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_CLIENT_EMAIL, GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_PRIVATE_KEY (can reuse Firebase service account with GA4 Viewer access)
